# CCASS_Scraper
Scraping data from Hong Kong Ex's CCASS.

<p> This program could scrape the public data from HKEX's CCASS holding. <br>
  Please be noted that the HKEX's CCASS data can only track back to 1 year before. </p>

<p> Please be noted that there is T+2 and one day delay in CCASS reporting. </p>

<p> This is the part 1 of the whole project, I will finish the rest regarding the individual stock holding, but most importantly is constructing the database. Since the data disclosure window is moving on daily basis. If you want the full historical record, you may visit Webb-site.com </p>
